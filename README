This project demonstrates how to use a Javascript and Java clients connecting to the Kaazing WebSocket Gateway.

Requirements:
- Kaazing WebSocket Gateway JMS Edition 3.2.5

How to get it running:
- Start the KWG by running $KWG_HOME/bin/gateway.start
- Copy the JavaScript client (my_gateway_js_client.html) to $KWG_HOME/web/extras/demo/jms
- Go to http://localhost:8001/demo/jms/javascript/my_gateway_js_client.html. Make sure the client shows up in your browser.
- Start the Java client by running java MyGatewayJavaClient on command prompt or your favorite IDE. Don't forget to setup your CLASSPATH
to include the the following jar files: com.kaazing.gateway.jms.client.java.jar and geronimo-jms_1.1_spec-1.1.jar available under $KWG_HOME/lib/client/java and $KWG_HOME/lib respectively.
- Connect the Web client and send messages to the Kaazing WebSocket Gateway. If everything is setup correctly you should receive the messages on your Java client.
